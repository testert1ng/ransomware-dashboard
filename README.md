We have setup an acceptance testing version of our work in progress ransomware dashboard. 

The dashboard is a small web application where an attacker can manage their current ransomware campaigns and monitor the status of payments.
You are tasked with performing a black-box penetration security test against this application:

- You are permitted to perform any manner of testing against the application, using any tools and techniques with the exception of Denial of Service (DoS)
- The scope is the HTTP service listening on TCP port 80 only
- There are no hidden subdomains, files or services â€“ the entire scope of the application can be directly accessed via the following URL

Once you have completed testing, we request the following outputs:

- A dot-point list of all observations identified
- One written recommendation to address the highest-risk observation identified

The application will remain online for 1 week, or until we received your testing results.
